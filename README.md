# HybridsProject
This is a study on genetic basis for extensive divergence in developmental gene expression during life history evolution in sea urchin Heliocidaris.

To reproduce the results:
1. Download the Rmd file. Download the RawData folder and all the data files in the folder.
2. In RStudio, set the working dirctory as the folder where the Rmd file and RawData folder are saved. 
3. After running the Rmd file, an output folder will be generated and all the results will be saved in this output folder.
4. The entire process takes hours to finish. 
5. To repeart, delete the output folder and run the Rmd file again.
